## 📄 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of sales and customer data for a coffee retail business. Using **Python**, I cleaned, transformed, and analyzed raw transaction data to uncover key trends in customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and payment preferences.

The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`), utilizing the **Pandas** library for data manipulation and **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for data visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring consistency across datasets.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns in sales over time and across different locations.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Understanding who the top customers are and their buying habits.
* **Product Analysis:** Determining which coffee products drive the most revenue.

## 🗂️ Data Description
The analysis uses two primary datasets merged to create a holistic view of the business:

* **`transactions.csv`:** Contains details on individual sales, including transaction dates, product details, and quantities.
* **`customer_details.csv`:** Stores demographic details such as customer location, membership status, and payment methods.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * `Pandas` & `NumPy` (Data Manipulation)
    * `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` (Data Visualization)
    * `Jupyter Notebook` (Interactive Development Environment)

## 📊 Key Insights & Analysis
The notebook explores several business questions, including:
1.  **Sales Trends:** Analysis of peak sales hours and seasonal trends.
2.  **Top Products:** Identification of best-selling coffee blends and food items.
3.  **Payment Preferences:** Breakdown of cash vs. card vs. digital wallet usage among customers.
4.  **Customer Loyalty:** Analysis of repeat customers versus one-time buyers.
