## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales and customer data for a coffee retail chain. Using **Python**, raw transaction logs are cleaned, transformed, and explored to uncover trends in customer behavior, product performance, and payment preferences.

The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook, using **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualization.

## Objectives
* **Data Preparation:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and combining datasets.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns in sales, peak hours, and customer segments.
* **Cross-Month Comparison:** Comparing February and March data for growth trends and behavioral shifts.
* **Product Analysis:** Determining which coffees drive the most revenue.

## Data Description
The analysis uses two datasets combined for a holistic view:

* **`transactions.csv`** - Transaction-level sales data including datetime, card ID, coffee name, payment type, and amount.
* **`customer_details.csv`** - Additional customer transaction records with datetime, coffee name, payment type, and amount.
